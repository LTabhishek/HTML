            <b>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus
            gallus), originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of
            the
            most common and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and
            eggs, though they are also kept as pets.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced
            annually for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat
            and
            egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social
            animals with complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across
            many
            societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.
